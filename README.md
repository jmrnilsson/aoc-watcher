# ðŸŽ„ AoC Watcher ðŸŽ„ 

Allows for an automated browser experience during `Advent of Code` subsmissions. Verified on Windows with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/), [Brave](https://brave.com/) with interop against [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) only. If you prefer something else there are serveral [other tools](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli) that could be worth a try. Built with [Chrome Remote Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chrome-remote-interface) and Javascript.

- Dowloads the puzzle input.
- Polls a process and reads stardard output or standard error expecting JSON.
- Does a challange against any previous answer submissions (if any).
- Submits and continues to part 2 if OK.

The browser will have to authenticate at some point. Might just do that in same browser that will run the debugger.

## Setup
Use `npm i` with the latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
## Running

Start a browser with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled but without headless option off (preferably). Or customize and run `safari.sh`,
`firefox.ps1` or `./brave.ps1` to your needs. 

Some enviroment variables needs to be set. Here an example (on Windows) but you might just want to change the script used or use an
env-file.

> **Note:** Days will be padded with single digit zero fill (for now).

```pwsh
# Kindly note that this is not your typical environment variable but a template string
# using Mustasche.
$env:AOCW_PUZZLE_FILE = 'puzzle.txt'
$env:AOCW_PUZZLE_FOLDER = 'C:\\development\\aoc\\year_{{year}}\\day_{{day}}\\'
$env:AOCW_MODULE = 'C:\\development\\aoc\\year_{{year}}\\day_{{day}}\\solve.py'
$env:AOCW_EXEC = 'C:\\development\\aoc\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe'

# For awaiting "todays" puzzle:
node .\main.js

# Or a specific other day with:
node .\main.js "2022-12-01"
```

## Implementing support for puzzles answers
The watcher does interop via standard output from a user configured process. If the output conforms to the following JSON example it's evaluated. Anything else, including standard error, is logged in the console. 

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "puzzle": 1475698
  "test": 42
}
```
